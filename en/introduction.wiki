=BEAR.Sunday=

BEAR.Sunday is an elegant, no-mess, 'Zen' inspired framework from Japan.

This resource orientated framework has both externally and internally a REST centric architecture, implementing 'Dependency Injection' and 'Aspect Orientated Programming' heavily to offer you surprising simplicity, order and flexibility in your application.

With very few components of its own, it is a fantastic example of how a framework can be built using existing components and libraries from other frameworks, yet offer even further benefit and beauty.
